{"id": "income_tax_act_2025_213", "text": "the annual accretion in the tax year to the employee’s balance in a recognised provident fund consisting of— (a) contributions made by the employer exceeding 12% of the employee’s salary; and (b) interest credited on the balance to the credit of an employee in so far as it is allowed at a rate exceeding such rate as fixed by the Central Government by notification, shall be deemed to have been received by the employee and included in his total income for that tax year and shall be liable to income tax. 7. Exemption for employee’s contributions.—An employee participating in a recognised provident fund shall, in respect of his own contributions to his individual account in the fund in the tax year, be entitled to a deduction in the computation of his total income of an amount determined as per section 123. 8. Exclusion from total income of accumulated balance—(1) Subject to the provisions of sub-paragraph (2), the accumulated balance due and payable to an employee shall be excluded from the computation of his total income— (a) if the employee has rendered continuous service with his employer for five years or more; or (b) even if, the employee has not served continuously, the service was terminated due to–– (i) the employee’s ill-health; or (ii) by the contraction or closure of the employer’s business; or (iii) other cause beyond the control of the employee; (c) if, on the cessation of his employment, the employee obtains employment with any other employer, to the extent the accumulated balance due and becoming payable to him is transferred to his individual account in any recognised provident fund maintained by such other employer; or (d) the entire balance standing to the employee’s credit is transferred to his account under a pension scheme referred to in section 124 and notified by the Central Government. (2) Where the accumulated balance due and payable to an employee includes any amount transferred from another recognised provident fund or funds of a previous employer or employers, the continuous service period for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1)(a) or (b) shall include the period or periods served under the aforesaid previous employer or employers. 9. Tax on accumulated balance.—Where the accumulated balance due to an employee is included in his total income owing to the provisions of paragraph 8 not being applicable, then— (a) the Assessing Officer shall calculate the total of the various sums of tax which would have been payable by the employee in respect of his total income for each of the years concerned if the fund had not been a recognised provident fund; and Sec. 1] THE GAZETTE OF IN5D5I1A EXTRAORDINARY 551 (b) the amount by which such total exceeds the total of all sums paid by or on behalf of such employee by way of tax for such years shall be payable by the employee in addition to any other tax for which he may be liable for the tax year in which the accumulated balance due to him becomes payable. 10. Deduction at source of tax payable on accumulated balance.—In cases where paragraph 9 applies–– (a) the trustees of a recognised provident fund; or (b) any person authorised by the regulations of the fund to make payment of accumulated balances due to employees, shall deduct from the accumulated balance at the time of payment, the amount payable under the rule and the provisions of Chapter XIX-B shall apply as if the accumulated balance were income chargeable under the head “Salaries”. 11. Treatment of balance in newly recognised provident fund.—(1) Where recognition is accorded to a provident fund with existing balances, an account shall be made of the fund up to the day immediately preceding the day on which the recognition takes effect,— (a) showing the balance to the credit of each employee on such day; and (b) containing such further particulars as may be prescribed. (2) The account shall also show in respect of balance to the credit of each employee— (a) the amount thereof to be transferred to the employee’s account in the recognised provident fund (herein referred to as transferred balance); and (b) such “transferred balance” shall be shown as balance to his credit in the recognised provident fund on the date on which the recognition takes effect, and sub-paragraph (4) and paragraph 5(5) shall apply accordingly. (3) Any part of the balance to the credit of each employee in the existing fund not transferred to the recognised fund shall be excluded from the recognised fund’s account and shall be liable to income-tax as per the provisions of this Act, other than this Part. (4) Subject to rules made by the Board in this behalf,— (a) the Assessing Officer shall calculate the aggregate of all amounts in the transferred balance that would have been liable to income-tax if this Part had been in force since the fund’s institution, without regard to any tax which may have been paid on any amount; (b) the aggregate of amounts in a transferred balance, if any, shall be deemed to be income received by the employee in the tax year in which the recognition of the fund takes effect and shall be included in the employee’s total income for that tax year; (c) for the purposes of assessment, the remainder of the transferred balance shall be disregarded, but no other exemption or relief, by way of refund or otherwise, shall be granted in respect of any sum comprised in such transferred balance. (5) In cases of serious accounting difficulty, the approving authority may, subject to rules, make a summary calculation of the aggregate as provided in sub-paragraph (4). (6) Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the rights of the persons administering an unrecognised provident fund or dealing with it, or with the balance to the credit of any individual employee prior to recognition, in any manner permitted by law. 12. Accounts of recognised provident funds.—(1) The accounts of a recognised provident fund shall be maintained by the trustees of the fund in such form, for such period, and contain such particulars, as may be prescribed. 552 THE GAZETTE OF IN5D5I2A EXTRAORDINARY [Part II— (2) The accounts shall be available to inspection by the income-tax authorities at all reasonable times, and the trustees shall provide the Assessing Officer with the abstracts of such accounts as may be prescribed. 13. Appeal.—(1) An employer objecting to an order of the approving authority not granting recognition or withdrawing recognition from a provident fund may appeal to the Board, within sixty days of such order. (2) The appeal shall be in such form and verified in such manner, and subject to the payment of such fee as may be prescribed. 14. Treatment of fund transferred by employer to trustee.—(1) When an employer who maintains a provident fund, whether recognised or not, for the benefit of his employees and has not transferred the fund or portion of it, transfers such fund or portion to trustees in trust for the participating employees, the transferred amount shall be deemed to be of the nature of capital expenditure.
