    "question": "Should I choose the new tax regime or the old tax regime for FY 2025-26?",
    "answer": "From FY 2025-26, the new tax regime under section 115BAC is the default. It offers a higher basic exemption limit and more slabs with lower rates, but most deductions (like 80C, 80D, HRA, LTA, home loan interest on self-occupied property) are not available. The old regime has a lower basic exemption and higher tax rates but allows most deductions and exemptions. As a rough rule: if your total deductions (80C + 80D + NPS + HRA + home-loan interest etc.) are high, the old regime may be better; if they are low and your income is below about ₹12 lakh, the new regime usually gives lower tax due to the higher rebate."

    "question": "What are the income tax slab rates under the new tax regime for FY 2025-26?",
    "answer": "Under the new tax regime for FY 2025-26 (AY 2026-27), the slabs are: 0 to ₹4,00,000 – 0%; ₹4,00,001 to ₹8,00,000 – 5%; ₹8,00,001 to ₹12,00,000 – 10%; ₹12,00,001 to ₹16,00,000 – 15%; ₹16,00,001 to ₹20,00,000 – 20%; ₹20,00,001 to ₹24,00,000 – 25%; and above ₹24,00,000 – 30%. Health and education cess and any surcharge apply on top of the slab tax."

    "question": "Up to what income is there no tax under the new regime for FY 2025-26?",
    "answer": "Under the revised section 87A, if your total taxable income under the new regime is up to ₹12,00,000, a rebate is available which can fully offset the tax. Practically, this means that after considering the standard deduction and slab rates, your final tax liability can be reduced to zero if your taxable income does not exceed ₹12 lakh. Above this limit, the rebate tapers off and you will pay tax as per the slabs."

    "question": "What are the income tax slab rates under the old tax regime?",
    "answer": "Under the old regime, the slabs remain the same as earlier: 0 to ₹2,50,000 – 0%; ₹2,50,001 to ₹5,00,000 – 5%; ₹5,00,001 to ₹10,00,000 – 20%; and above ₹10,00,000 – 30%. You can also claim deductions like 80C, 80D, 80CCD(1B), and exemptions like HRA, LTA etc., subject to the conditions."

    "question": "How much deduction can I claim under section 80C and what investments are allowed?",
    "answer": "Section 80C allows a maximum deduction of ₹1,50,000 from your total income, subject to overall limits clubbed with 80CCC and 80CCD(1). Eligible payments include life insurance premiums, employee contributions to EPF, PPF deposits, NSC, ELSS mutual funds, children’s tuition fees (for up to two children), principal repayment of a home loan, 5-year tax-saving bank FDs, Sukanya Samriddhi deposits and certain other specified schemes. The deduction is available only under the old regime."

    "question": "What is the deduction available for health insurance premiums under section 80D?",
    "answer": "Under section 80D, individuals and HUFs can claim deductions for health insurance premiums and certain medical expenses. For self, spouse and dependent children, the limit is typically up to ₹25,000 per year, and an additional ₹25,000 for parents (higher limits apply if the insured persons are senior citizens). Within the overall limit, a portion can also be used for preventive health check-ups. This deduction is available only when you opt for the old regime."

    "question": "What is the standard deduction from salary and who can claim it?",
    "answer": "A standard deduction from salary income is available to salaried individuals and pensioners. In your project’s assumptions, under the new regime this deduction is up to ₹75,000 from gross salary. Under the old regime, the standard deduction amount may differ, but the idea is the same: it is an automatic flat deduction for salary or pension income and does not require any bills or proofs."

    "question": "Can I claim a deduction for home loan interest on my self-occupied property?",
    "answer": "Under section 24(b), you can claim a deduction on interest paid on a home loan for a self-occupied house property, subject to a maximum cap (commonly ₹2,00,000) per year, provided certain conditions are met such as completion of construction within the specified time. This deduction is available only when you opt for the old regime. Under the new regime, this home loan interest benefit for self-occupied property is generally not allowed."

    "question": "How does Finora compare tax under old and new regimes for salary income?",
    "answer": "Finora first calculates your gross salary and applies the standard deduction. For the old regime, it subtracts eligible deductions such as 80C, 80D, 80CCD(1B), home loan interest and considers exemptions like HRA where applicable to compute taxable income, then applies old-regime slabs. For the new regime, it applies only the allowed deductions (like standard deduction) and then applies the new-regime slabs and rebate. It finally compares the tax payable under both regimes and recommends the one with lower tax."

    "tags": ["ITR", "forms", "filing"],
    "question": "Which ITR form should I use for my income?",
    "answer": "The correct ITR form depends on your sources of income, residential status and other factors. For example, individuals having income mainly from salary or pension with limited other sources typically use ITR-1 or ITR-2. Those with business or professional income, including presumptive income under sections 44AD or 44ADA, may need ITR-3 or ITR-4. Finora can guide you at a high level, but you should verify the correct form each year from the official e-filing portal."

    "question": "How is short-term capital gain on equity shares taxed?",
    "answer": "Short-term capital gains on listed equity shares or equity-oriented mutual fund units, where securities transaction tax (STT) is paid, are generally taxed at a special rate (for example, 15%). To compute STCG, you subtract the purchase cost and eligible expenses from the sale value. The resulting gain is then taxed at the applicable STCG rate plus surcharge and cess, and is not taxed at the slab rates in most cases."

    "question": "How is long-term capital gain on equity shares taxed?",
    "answer": "Long-term capital gains on listed equity shares or equity mutual funds, where STT is paid and the holding period exceeds 12 months, are covered by section 112A. Typically, gains above a specified exemption threshold (such as ₹1 lakh per year) are taxed at a concessional rate (for example 10% plus surcharge and cess) without indexation. Gains up to the exemption limit are tax-free, and only the excess is taxed at the special rate."

    "question": "Can I save capital gains tax on sale of a residential house?",
    "answer": "Yes. If you sell a long-term residential house property and reinvest the capital gains or the net consideration into another residential house within prescribed timelines, you may claim exemption under section 54, subject to conditions. The new house must be purchased or constructed within specified periods and usually must be located in India. If the conditions are not met, the exemption can be withdrawn later. Finora can show you the rough tax impact with and without claiming the exemption."

    "question": "What are 54EC bonds and how do they help in saving capital gains tax?",
    "answer": "Section 54EC allows you to reinvest long-term capital gains from certain assets, such as land and buildings, into specified bonds like those issued by NHAI or REC within the prescribed time limit. Subject to the investment cap and other conditions, the amount invested in these bonds can be exempt from capital gains tax. These bonds usually have a lock-in period, during which they cannot be sold or pledged."

    "question": "Can I set off or carry forward my capital losses?",
    "answer": "Capital losses can generally be set off only against capital gains. Short-term capital loss can be set off against both STCG and LTCG, whereas long-term capital loss can typically be set off only against LTCG. Unabsorbed capital losses can often be carried forward for a limited number of years if you file your return within the due date. The detailed rules are technical, so Finora can give you a basic view but major planning should be double-checked with a tax professional."

    "question": "When do I need to register for GST?",
    "answer": "GST registration is required when your aggregate turnover exceeds the threshold limit prescribed for your state and type of business, or if you fall under mandatory registration categories such as inter-state supply, e-commerce operators, and certain notified services. The exact threshold varies by state and business type. Once registered, you must charge GST, issue tax invoices, file periodic returns and comply with other provisions."

    "question": "How can I find the GST rate applicable to my product or service?",
    "answer": "GST rates are linked to HSN or SAC codes. You can use the official HSN-wise GST rate list to look up the product category and find the corresponding rate (such as 5%, 12%, 18% or 28%). In Finora’s context, the GST rate can be derived from your `hscodewiselistwithgstrates` document. Always check whether the item is exempt, nil-rated or under a special notification before finalising the rate."

    "question": "What is input tax credit under GST and when can I claim it?",
    "answer": "Input tax credit (ITC) allows a registered GST taxpayer to set off the GST paid on purchases (inputs, input services and capital goods) against the GST collected on sales. To claim ITC, you must have a valid tax invoice, the supplier must have reported the supply and paid the tax, and you must use the goods or services in the course of business. ITC is not available on certain blocked items like personal consumption, some motor vehicles and specific restricted categories."

    "tags": ["gst", "returns", "GSTR-1", "GSTR-3B"],
    "question": "Which GST returns do I need to file as a regular taxpayer?",
    "answer": "A regular GST-registered taxpayer typically files GSTR-1 to report outward supplies (sales) and GSTR-3B as a summary self-declaration of outward and inward supplies with tax payment. There may be additional returns or statements depending on the type of registration, such as annual returns. Due dates and formats can change over time, so always refer to the latest instructions on the GST portal."

    "question": "What is the GST composition scheme and who can opt for it?",
    "answer": "The composition scheme is a simplified GST scheme for eligible small taxpayers up to a specified turnover limit. Under this scheme, the taxpayer pays tax at a lower, fixed rate on turnover, files fewer returns, and cannot collect GST from customers or claim input tax credit. It is suitable for very small businesses that prefer simplicity over claiming ITC. Eligibility, turnover limits and rates are notified by the government and may change from time to time."

    "question": "How is TDS on salary calculated and deducted?",
    "answer": "TDS on salary is deducted by the employer based on your estimated annual taxable salary for the financial year and the tax regime you choose. The employer estimates total income, subtracts eligible deductions and exemptions, computes total tax, and divides it across the remaining months of the year to arrive at a monthly TDS amount. At year end, the employer issues Form 16 summarising salary details and tax deducted."

    "tags": ["TDS", "thresholds", "sections"],
    "question": "What are TDS thresholds and why did they change from April 2025?",
    "answer": "TDS thresholds are the minimum payment amounts under various sections above which tax must be deducted at source. From 1 April 2025, several TDS thresholds were increased under multiple sections (for example, on interest, dividends, rent, professional fees and other payments) with the aim of reducing the compliance burden on small taxpayers and small payments. If your income from a particular source stays below the relevant threshold, no TDS is required under that section."

    "answer": "Tax Collected at Source (TCS) may apply on certain foreign remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) and on overseas tour programme packages when payments exceed the prescribed thresholds. The Finance Act 2025 increased some of these thresholds and relaxed TCS in certain education-related remittances. In practice, your bank or authorised dealer collects TCS and reports it in your Form 26AS. You can claim credit for this TCS while filing your income tax return."

    "answer": "If more TDS or TCS has been deducted than your final tax liability, you can claim a refund when you file your income tax return. The credit for TDS/TCS appears in your Form 26AS or AIS, and Finora can factor it into your tax computation. Once the return is processed, the income tax department issues a refund to your bank account along with interest where applicable."

    "tags": ["44AD", "small business", "turnover"],
    "question": "What is presumptive taxation under section 44AD?",
    "answer": "Section 44AD provides a presumptive taxation scheme for eligible small businesses up to a specified turnover limit. Instead of maintaining detailed books and claiming actual expenses, the taxpayer declares a fixed percentage of turnover (for example, 6% or 8% depending on mode of receipts) as income, and tax is computed on that presumptive income. Books of account and audit requirements are relaxed if conditions are met. However, switching in and out of the scheme has restrictions that should be reviewed carefully."

    "question": "Who can use presumptive taxation under section 44ADA?",
    "answer": "Section 44ADA is available for certain eligible professions such as legal, medical, engineering, architecture, accountancy, technical consultancy and some others, up to a prescribed gross receipts limit. Under this scheme, 50% of the gross receipts are deemed to be income, and tax is calculated on this amount. Detailed expense records are not needed if you accept the presumptive income. If you wish to declare lower income, you normally have to maintain books and may be subject to audit."

    "tags": ["advantages", "disadvantages", "books of account"],
    "question": "What are the pros and cons of opting for presumptive taxation?",
    "answer": "The main advantages of presumptive taxation are simplified compliance, no need for detailed books in many cases, and straightforward tax computation based on a fixed percentage of turnover or receipts. The disadvantages include loss of the ability to claim actual higher expenses, possible restrictions on carrying forward losses, and conditions on switching out of the scheme in future years. It is most useful for very small and stable businesses or professionals with low expense ratios."

    "answer": "The due date for filing your income tax return depends on your category: individual non-audit cases typically have one due date, while persons requiring audit or transfer pricing reports may have later due dates. The exact dates are notified each year and can sometimes be extended. Finora can remind you of typical timelines, but you should always check the current year’s due dates on the official e-filing portal."

Tax laws change over time, and individual situations can be complex. You should always verify critical numbers on the official government portals or with a qualified tax professional before filing returns or making major financial decisions."
